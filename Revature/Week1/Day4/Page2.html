                <h2>What is a black hole?</h2>
                <p>A black hole is a region of space where the gravitational field is so dense that nothing can
                    escape from its pull, not even light. This occurs due to the collapse of matter within the black hole,
                    which is most often caused from a dying star. It is theorized that every galaxy has a black hole in the center
                    of it, even though they are invisible to the naked eye since there is no light escaping from it.
                    It is thought that the rotation of the galaxies is in part caused by everything circulating slowly around a black hole.

                    <h3><em>Relevancy to wormholes</em></h3>
                    <p>It is speculated that black holes could be an entrance to a wormhole, which would exit out
                        the other side through a white hole. If this were true, it would be nearly impossible for humans
                        to use them for travel with our current understanding of physics. No model shows that humans could survive entering
                        a black hole. We would be crushed and stretched out by the intense gravity.

                <h4><strong>Conclusions</strong></h4>
                <p>All signs seem to indicate that black holes are not a viable entrance to a wormhole without some form of
                    hyper-advanced technology which would be outside of our current understanding of physics. We would require
                    some discovery which rewrites some of the ways we fundamentally think about physics in our universe.
