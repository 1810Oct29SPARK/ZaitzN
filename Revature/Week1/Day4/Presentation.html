                <h2>What is a wormhole?</h2>
                <p>While only theoretical, wormholes are passages through space-time itself which could be used as shortcuts across great distances. Wormholes are predicted to exist by the theory of general relativity but have not been proven so far.</p>

                    <h3><em>Wormhole theory</em></h3>
                    <p>Wormhole theory has existed since as early as 1916, but would not come to be known as wormholes until later.
                        Austrian physicist Ludwig Flamm was reviewing Einstein's work on general relativity, he came up with a different solution.
                        Flamm described this as a "white hole," a theoretical time reversal of a black hole. It was imagined that these "white holes" could be connected to black holes with some kind of tunnel between them.
                    </p>
                    <pre><strong>
            In 1935, Einstein and Nathan Rosen elaborated on this idea by proposing
            the existence of "bridges" through space-time. These bridges would connect
            two different points in space-time which would create a shortcut between
            these two locations. These bridges would later come to be known as wormholes.</strong></pre>

                <h4><strong>How real are they?</strong></h4>
                <p>According to Stephen Hsu, a theoretical physics professor at the University
                    of Oregon, "The whole thing is very hypothetical at this point. No one thinks we're
                    going to find a wormhole anytime soon." So while the math seems to support the theory
                    that wormholes do indeed exist, it seems like it will be a while until anyone really knows for sure.
                    Even if they do exist, whether or not they will be useful for space travel still remains
                    to be seen.
