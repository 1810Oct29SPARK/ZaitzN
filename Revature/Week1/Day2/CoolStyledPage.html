            <p>You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.

        <div class="textDiv">
            <p>And right there you got an almighty cloud. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.

                See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.
                
                Let's have a little bit of fun today. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.
